Code your own PCA class
=======================

- Code an own PCA class using what you have learned in the lecture
- Use script named "Ch05 - exercise 01 - script.py" to see how it should work and what results you should get
- Find the solution in file "myPCA.py"
- Try to use the solution as little as possible, but use it when you get stuck
- Use also the Juptyer notebook of chapter 05 for help: https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch05/ch05.ipynb
