Code your own LDA class
=======================

- Code an own LDA class using what you have learned in the lecture
- Use script named "Ch05 - exercise 02 - script.py" to see how it should work and what results you should get
- Find the solution in file "myLDA.py"
- Try to use the solution as little as possible, but use it when you get stuck
- Use also the Juptyer notebook of chapter 05 for help: https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch05/ch05.ipynb

About your PCA class
--------------------
- Your own PCA class should be stored in file "myLDA.py"
- It should contain the following the following methods:
	* __init__ (input parameter: n_components, scaled_S_W)
	* fit (input parameter: X, y)
	* transform (input paramter: X)
	* get_cumulative_discriminability_ratio (no input parameter)
