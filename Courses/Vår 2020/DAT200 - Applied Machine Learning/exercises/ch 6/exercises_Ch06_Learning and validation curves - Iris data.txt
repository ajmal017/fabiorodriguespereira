Iris data

1. Compute learning and validation curves using the StandardScaler and Logistic Regression with L2-regularization. 
2. Repeat the learning curve for a good choice of the L2 parameter and check if it has changed.

Tip 1: learning_curve fails using the original sample order of the Iris data
Tip 2: Named steps in a pipeline can be accessed using .named_steps['mystep'] and their parameters changed using .set_params(param_name=param_value)
