Use the MNIST data of hand-written digits from: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html

Cluster the first 1000 digits using 2-100 clusters and K-means/Fuzzy c-means.

Monitor the development of the distortion as you vary the number of clusters,
and inspect the purity of the clusters 
(proportion of most common digit, e.g. through scipy.stats.mode).
Plot relative distortions (divide by first/highest value) and purity together.

Bonus: Create a cluster-based classifier from the "best" clustering and assess its
performance on the remaining digits.
